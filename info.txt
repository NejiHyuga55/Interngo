Technical Excellence

Proper error handling throughout

Memory-efficient sparse matrix operations

Consistent dimensionality handling

Serialization for deployment

ðŸ”§ Areas for Improvement
Circular Reference Error (in Step 1.5)

The JSON serialization fails due to circular references

Solution: Use a custom JSON encoder or simplify the data structure before serialization

Evaluation Metrics (in Step 5)

The MAP scores are quite low (0.1-0.138)

This suggests the recommendation algorithm might need tuning

Consider experimenting with different feature weights or algorithms

Cold Start Problem

The system might struggle with new users or internships

Consider implementing fallback strategies or popularity-based recommendations
